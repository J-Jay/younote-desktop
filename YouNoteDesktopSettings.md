# Pre requisites #

YouNote and YouNote Desktop work together wirelessly (home local network or internet for example). In consequence, for best results, your iPhone must use a WIFI access.

YouNote Desktop can handle several devices so you can use a single YouNote Desktop to backup/restore more than one iPhone/iPod. YouNote recognizes automatically the appropriate device.

**Important 1:** you can't backup/restore your notes when your iPhone/iPod Touch is tethered to your Mac/PC.

**Important 2:** even if we don't answer to your comments, we read them and we will enhance YouNote Desktop accordingly.

**Important 3:** Look at the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/Sophiacom/younote-backup-instructions-en). It contains screen shots so it easier to understand than reading this technical not.

# Details #

In order to backup and restore your notes on your iPhone, you have some parameters to enter.

## The easy way: using Bonjour ##

If you are using a Mac or if you have Bonjour installed on your PC (apparently, iTunes installs Bonjour on Windows), you are lucky.

If you don't have it, take a look [here (Apple site)](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows.html)

The first step is to initialize YouNote Desktop by following this instructions:
  * launch YouNote Desktop
  * select Preferences item in the Edit menu
  * choose a backup folder (folder that will contain all your backups)

Click on the OK button. That's it.

On your iPhone, launch YouNote then follow this instructions:
  * display the list of notes
  * on the bottom left corner, tap the "Backup" icon
  * your computer is displayed automatically
  * select your desktop in the list (you can have several YouNote Desktop installed on different computers but it can be confusing !).

You are ready to backup/restore your notes.

The first time YouNote establishes a connection, YouNote Desktop displays a pass code. You should type this code when YouNote will ask. Automatically, YouNote will establish the connection with YouNote Desktop.

## The less easy way ##

If you don't use Bonjour, it's more complex specially on the iPhone side.

The first step is to initialize YouNote Desktop by following this instructions:
  * launch YouNote Desktop
  * select Preferences item in the Edit menu
  * choose a backup folder (folder that will contain all your backups)
  * leave the server port field empty (YouNote Desktop will find automatically a port for you)

Click on the OK button. That's it.

On your iPhone, launch YouNote then follow this instructions:
  * display the list of notes
  * on the bottom left corner, tap the "Backup" icon
  * tap on the "Edit" button
  * choose "Add server"
  * enter a configuration name (for example Home or Office)
  * the IP address of your PC/Mac
  * the port you have entered or assigned automatically by YouNote Desktop

Then touch the OK button and you are ready to backup/restore your notes.

To delete a configuration, click on the "Edit" button (like adding a configuration), tap on the "minus" sign of the configuration to delete then tap on the "Delete" button.

The first time YouNote establishes a connection, YouNote Desktop displays a pass code. You should type this code when YouNote will ask. Automatically, YouNote will establish the connection with YouNote Desktop.
