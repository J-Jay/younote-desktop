= Description =

===An alert on your iPhone/iPod Touch displays "Unable to connect to the selected backup server"===
If you tap the Backup button and have this message, that turns out that YND is unreachable.

_Solution_: disable the firewall on your desktop or enter a port in YND settings and modify the rules of your firewall. Look at the instructions user (link on the [http://code.google.com/p/younote-desktop Project Home Page])

===The backup fails when the iPhone is in standby mode===
If the backup phase is too long, your iPhone switches over to standby mode. The consequence is that the connection is broken. Or YouNote stops backing up after 30 mn. 

Don't use the battery: plug you iPhone/iPod. Or your iPhone will break the wifi connection after 30 mn.
