= Description =

===The AudioNotes are not always backed up===
Some !AudioNotes created with a prior release of YN are not sent to YND. In consequence, they are not backed up.

This issue has been fixed with YN 1.1.1.
===The backup fails when the iPhone is in standby mode===
If the backup phase is too long, your iPhone switches over to standby mode. The consequence is that the connection is broken.

This issue has been fixed with YN 1.1.1.
===The backup fails when the connection between YN and YND is too slow===
In certain circumstances, the connection between YN and YND is lost, for example if you backup your notes through internet.

This issue has been fixed with YND 1.2.

===The backup fails when the archive is too big===
When the archive is too big (with a lots of AudioNotes for example or only with a big one like a meeting), YN crashes.

This issue has been fixed with YN 1.1.2.

===An alert on your iPhone displays "Unable to connect to the selected backup server"===
If you tap the Backup button and have this message, that turns out that YND is unreachable.

_Solution_: disable the firewall on your desktop or enter a port in YND settings and modify the rules of your firewall.
