= Description =

===The AudioNotes are not always backed up===
Some AudioNotes created with a prior release of YN are not sent to YND. In consequence, they are not backed up.

_Workaround_: listen once an AudioNote with YN 1.1

This issue will be fixed in the next update of YN (release 1.1.1).

===The backup fails when the iPhone is in standby mode===
If the backup phase is too long, your iPhone switches over to standby mode. The consequence is that the connection is broken.

_Workaround_: tap the screen time to time

This issue will be fixed in the next update of YN (release 1.1.1).
===The backup fails when the connection between YN and YND is too slow===
In certain circumstances, the connection between YN and YND is lost, for example if you backup your notes through internet.

_Workaround_: none

This issue will be fixed in the next update of YND (release 1.1.1).

===The backup fails when the archive is too big===
When the archive is too big (with a lots of AudioNotes for example or only with a big one like a meeting), YN crashes.

_Workaround_: none

This issue should be fixed in the next update of YND (release 1.1.1). We still try to find the right way to achieve this task.
