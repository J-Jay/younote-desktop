= Pre requisites =

YouNote and YouNote Desktop work together when they can establish a connection through a network (home local network or internet for example). In consequence, for best results, your iPhone must use a WIFI access.

*Important 1:* you can't backup/restore your notes when your iPhone/iPod Touch is tethered to your Mac/PC.

*Important 2:* even if we don't answer to your comments, we read them and we will enhance YouNote Desktop accordingly.

In order to backup and restore your notes on your iPhone, you have some parameters to enter.

==The easy way: using Bonjour==

If you are using a Mac or if you have Bonjour installed on your PC (apparently, iTunes installs Bonjour on Windows), you are lucky. 

If you don't have it, take a look [http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows.html here (Apple site)]

The first step is to initialize YouNote Desktop by following this instructions: 
  * launch YouNote Desktop 
  * select Preferences item in the YouNote menu 
  * choose a backup folder (folder that will contain all your backups) 
  * enter a Bonjour name (this name will be displayed on your iPhone) or leave this field empty

Click on the OK button. That's it.

The first time YouNote establishes a connection, YouNote Desktop displays a pass code. You should type this code when YouNote will ask. Automatically, YouNote will establish the connection with YouNote Desktop.

==The hard way ==

If you don't use Bonjour, you must enter a valid port number and put this value when you add manually a backup server on your iPhone.

The first step is to initialize YouNote Desktop by following this instructions: 
  * launch YouNote Desktop 
  * select Preferences item in the YouNote menu 
  * choose a backup folder (folder that will contain all your backups) 
  * leave the server port field empty (YouNote Desktop will find automatically a port for you)

Click on the OK button. That's it.

On your iPhone, you must add a configuration server (the most difficult step) by setting:
 * the IP address of your PC/Mac
 * the port you have entered or assigned automatically by YouNote Desktop
 * a configuration name (if you have several configurations at home or in your office)

*Important:* you can't delete a configuration with YouNote 1.1. It's not a big deal to have several configurations and we will fix that in the next release.

The first time YouNote establishes a connection, YouNote Desktop displays a pass code. You should type this code when YouNote will ask. Automatically, YouNote will establish the connection with YouNote Desktop.
