= Details =

The first step is to initialize YouNote Desktop by following this instructions: 
  * launch YouNote Desktop 
  * select Preferences item in the YouNote menu 
  * choose a backup folder (folder that will contain all your backups) 
  * enter a Bonjour name (this name will be displayed on your iPhone)

Click on the OK button. That's it.

The first time YouNote establishes a connection, YouNote Desktop displays a pass code. You should type this code when YouNote will ask.

If you don't use Bonjour, you must enter a valid port number and put this value when you add manually a backup server on your iPhone.
