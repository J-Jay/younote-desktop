YouNote Desktop is a desktop application for Mac OS X or Windows users that allows to backup and restore the notes created with YouNote on iPhone ([YouNote on the App Store](http://www.itunes.com/app/younote)) wirelessly.
The same tool is used if you want to **transfer your notes from YouNote Lite to YouNote.**

**How it works in brief?**

When you want to backup, YouNote establishes a connection with YouNote Desktop then send the notes. The notes are stored on your desktop in your local backup folder.

And when you want to restore, same process: YouNote downloads the notes stored in the chosen archive then recreates your notes on your iPhone.

Even if the minimal release requirement is YouNote 1.4, we recommend you to use the last release YN 1.6.2.

YouNote Desktop runs on Mac OS X (from 10.4 to 10.9) on Intel and even PowerPC (until 10.5 of course) and on Windows XP/Vista/7.

And one more thing: YouNote Desktop is in open source so other developers can contribute to enhance this application. If you would like to contribute to YouNote Desktop, drop us an email.
